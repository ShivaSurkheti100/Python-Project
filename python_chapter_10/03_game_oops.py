    def moveRight(self):
        pass
    def moveLeft(self):
        pass
    def moveTop(self):
        pass

remote1 = Remote() # remote1 is the object of Remote class
player1 = Player() # player1 is an object of Player class
# remote1 and plyer1 are variables ; Remote and Player chai class ko name
if(remote1.isLeftPressed()): # english langugae karib karib xa so real world modelling
    player1.moveLeft()
# just an example ; don't run
