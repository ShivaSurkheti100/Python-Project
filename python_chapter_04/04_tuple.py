# Creating a tuple using ()
t = (855, 2, 4, 5)
print(t)
# Printing the element of tuple
print(t[0])

# Cannot update the values of a tuple
# this is the major difference b\t list and tuple
#t[0] = 44 --> throws an error
# tuple doesnot support item assignment

# Empty tuple 13th line
t1 = ()
print(t1)
# tuple with single element
t1 = (1, )
print(t1)

t1 = (1) # wrong way to declare a tuple with single element
